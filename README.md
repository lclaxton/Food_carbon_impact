# Food_carbon_impact
 Investigating how are food habits drive climate change.

This is a simple project demonstrating my data visulaisation ability. There is a minor component of machine learning for some simple K-means clustering. 

Over all this was a pretty interesting project - I never knew the carbon cost of coffee until I worked with this dataset.
